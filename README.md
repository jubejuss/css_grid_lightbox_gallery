# css grid lightbox gallery
pure css lightbox

notes to myself:
create repo in your own computer (without README) and create github page:

echo "# css_grid_lightbox_gallery" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jubejuss/css_grid_lightbox_gallery.git
git push -u origin main

Then go to github > project setting  and find GitHub Pages, then coose instead of none, your branch and save.
It may take some 10 minutes before it showing up, but otherwise, it must be working.
